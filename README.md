Atomic Positions from LAMMPS molecular dynamics simulations for Aluminum

## Contents

This repository contains both the input and output of Molecular Dynamics simulations for Aluminum potentials.  This repository contains acronyms that correspond to the potential functions used in the [NIST potentials repository](www.ctcms.nist.gov/potentials/Al.html) for aluminum.

*Each folder contains*

* Initial atomic positions
* LAMMPS input for model parameters
* The positions of individual atoms in each simulation over time
